	<description>Extract DNA from animals and hybridize them to create new, exotic species!

&lt;size=24&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;
- Extract genes from Bears, Chickens, Boomalopes, Muffalos and Wolves, and create hybrids of these species.
- A bearalope is different from a boombear, so there are 25 new species to experiment with (plus 5 from Thrumbos!). Some very useful, some... less so.
- Once you research the advanced genetic engineering tech, you can also extract genes from Thrumbos and hybridize them!

&lt;size=24&gt;Issues&lt;/size&gt;
Some of the biggest animals might flicker. This is to be expected, since a few of them are bigger than Thrumbos!

&lt;size=24&gt;Notes&lt;/size&gt;
How do I progress? Here is a mini-guide:
- First, research the tech.
- Build a Pulper to get organic pulp from wood, and a Genetic Extraction Table to get DNA from animals and to build empty incubators.
- Kill the animals to extract their genes.
- Build the Gene Pod to mix the genes of different animals, and fill an empty incubator with the mixture.
- The incubator will hatch in a day. Keep it warm! You will need to tame the creature afterwards, of course.
- Results are random! If you mix Bear and Chicken, you might get a Bearchicken or a Chickenbear. Or the experiment can also go wrong...
- Finally, research the advanced tech, build the Advanced Gene Pod and experiment with Thrumbos to get the strongest creatures in the game.

&lt;size=24&gt;Plans for the future&lt;/size&gt;
I have many combinations in mind, so if people seem to enjoy this I'd be happy to add them :)
