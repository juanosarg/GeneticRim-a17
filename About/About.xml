	<description>Extract DNA from animals and hybridize them to create new, exotic species!

&lt;size=24&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;
- Extract genes from Bears, Chickens, Boomalopes, Muffalos, Wolves and Insectoids, and create hybrids of these species.
- A bearalope is different from a boombear, so there are 25 new species to experiment with, plus 6 from insectoids and 5 from Thrumbos, for a total of 36. Some very useful, some... less so.
- Once you research the advanced genetic engineering tech, you can also extract genes from Thrumbos and hybridize them!
- By extracting humanoid genes, you can mix them with animal genes and create several hybrid implants to improve your colonists.

&lt;size=24&gt;Issues&lt;/size&gt;
Some of the biggest animals might flicker. This is to be expected, since a few of them are bigger than Thrumbos!
The Boombeetle is a ranged creature, and the code for it is beta, so expect erratic behaviour.

&lt;size=24&gt;Notes&lt;/size&gt;
How do I progress? Here is a mini-guide:
- First, research the tech.
- Build a Pulper to get organic pulp from wood, and a Genetic Extraction Table to get DNA from animals and to build empty incubators.
- Kill the animals to extract their genes.
- Build the Gene Pod to mix the genes of different animals, and fill an empty incubator with the mixture.
- The incubator will hatch in a day. Keep it warm! You will need to tame the creature afterwards, of course.
- Results are random! If you mix Bear and Chicken, you might get a Bearchicken or a Chickenbear. Or the experiment can also go wrong...
- Finally, research the Insectoid Genome and the Advanced genetic engineering tech, build the Advanced Gene Pod and experiment with Insectoids and Thrumbos to get the strongest creatures in the game.
- On a different path, you can research humanoid genetic engineering, and develop hybrid implants to modify your colonists. Yeah, you can create a colonist that lays chicken eggs twice a day. It's hilarious and disgusting.

&lt;size=24&gt;Plans for the future&lt;/size&gt;
- Venomous, Armoured and Plant-like creatures
- Hybrids with creatures from other animal mods
- Weird special abilities for the existing creatures

&lt;size=24&gt;Compatibility&lt;/size&gt;
Made compatible with A Dog Said using the auto patcher: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=944381237
Should be savegame compatible and not break anything. Should!
